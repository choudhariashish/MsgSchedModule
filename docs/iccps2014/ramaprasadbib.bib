    Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation
and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today¿s computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today¿s abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.}

                 periodic tasks. Periodic tasks have regular arrival
                 times and hard deadlines. Aperiodic tasks have
                 irregular arrival times and either soft or hard
                 deadlines. In this paper, we present a new algorithm,
                 the Sporadic Server algorithm, that greatly improves
                 response times for soft-deadline aperiodic tasks and
                 can guarantee hard deadlines for both periodic and
                 aperiodic tasks. The operation of the Sporadic Server
                 algorithm, its performance, and schedulability analysis
                 are discussed and compared with previous, published
                 aperiodic service algorithms.",
