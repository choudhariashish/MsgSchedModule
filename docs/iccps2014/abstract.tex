Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a computer network of computational components that monitor and control switched physical systems interconnected by physical infrastructures. To integrate various components in CPS, we follow the \textit{invariant} based approach, where system is integrated based on the correctness of components instead of their functionality through conjunction of non-interfering logical invariants. Our distributed, adaptive power migration algorithm uses this approach to schedule power migration messages in the network to the desired nodes without compensating for stability of computer network as well as physical system. In this paper we mainly focus on network congestion and explore a well known Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme from CPS context and demonstrate the significant improvement in overall CPS efficiency and stability. Experimentation results show how the power transfers between smart grid nodes are unaffected if nodes are allowed to exploit ECN scheme while also taking necessary actions to reduce network congestion.
