Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of computational components interconnected by computer networks that monitor and control switched physical entities interconnected by physical infrastructures. To ensure a tight integration among the components in CPS we employ a novel approach that composes the correctness of components instead of their functionality using conjunction of non-interfering logical invariants. Our distributed algorithm developed for smart power grid nodes uses this approach to adaptively schedule power migrations in such a way that the stability of both the computer network and the physical system are maintained. In this paper we mainly focus on network congestion and explore a well known Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme from CPS context and demonstrate the significant improvement in overall CPS efficiency and stability. Experimentation results show how the power transfers between smart grid nodes are unaffected if nodes are allowed to exploit ECN scheme while also taking necessary actions to reduce network congestion.
