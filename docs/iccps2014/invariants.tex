\section{System Analysis And Invariant Formation}
\label{sec:invariants}

\subsection{Physical System Analysis}
The physical system must satisfy one out of several criteria in order to be
stable. The criteria are derived from an analysis of the continuous-time
dynamics of the system, which are modeled as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{d\omega}{dt} &=& -\frac{V_1 V_2}{J \omega X}sin(\theta - \theta_0)-\frac{D}{J}(\omega - \omega_0) + \frac{P_{imb}}{J\omega} - \frac{kP^2}{J\omega}, \nonumber \\
  \frac{d\theta}{dt} &=& \omega - \omega_0,
  \label{eqn:swing1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\omega$ is the frequency, $\theta$ is the phase angle of the generator voltage, $\omega_0$ and $\theta_0$ are their nominal
values, $P_{imb}$ is the net power imbalance due to outstanding messages,
and the other terms are various physical parameters.  The error energy, given by
\begin{equation}
  V(\omega, \theta) = \frac{J}{2} (\omega - \omega_0)^2 + \frac{V_1 V_2}{\omega X}(1-cos(\theta - \theta_0)).
  \label{eqn:lyap}
\end{equation}
is a Lyapunov function (that is, a positive-definite function with a
non-positive time derivative) if the system satisfies $I_{P1}$, given by
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
I_{P1}: (\omega - \omega_0)^2 \left(D\omega + m \right) \\ + (\omega - \omega_0)(kP^2)  > \delta K (\omega - \omega_0)
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\label{eqn:grid4}
\end{equation}
With other factors, $I_{P1}$ ultimately imposes a limit on $\delta * K$, where
$\delta$ is the quantum of power migrated with each message and $K$ is the
number of outstanding messages.

In general, if a Lyapunov function exists for a particular physical system, then
the system is stable. However, there are other conditions that also ensure
stability for a switched system, which is a continuous-time system that is
subject to external switching events. A \emph{Lyapunov-like} function
\cite{branicky98,ye98impulse,ye98hybrid} is similar to a Lyapunov function in
that it must be positive-definite, but its value may increase under some
conditions. If the value of the Lyapunov-like function decreases at each
switching event, then the system is stable. A final option is that the error may
not decay to zero, but is bounded.

{\bf Physical System Invariant($I_P$).}
Combining the three conditions, a single invariant may be found,
\begin{equation}
  \{I_P : I_{P1} \lor (V(\omega, \theta) < V_{bound}) \lor (V(t) \leq V(t_{x}))\}
  \label{eqn:IP}
\end{equation}
where $V_{bound}$ is the maximum allowable value of $V$, $V(t)$ is the value of
$V(\omega, \theta)$ at the present time and $V(t_{x})$ is its value at the most
recent previous violation of $I_{P1}$ due to a large value of $K$. Prior work
\cite{paul2011,paul12thesis} has demonstrated that the system can be stable for 
certain combinations of steady-state power imbalance and droop constants in 
the SST controllers.
 
\subsection{Network And Scheduling Analysis} 

As mentioned earlier, physical system stability at any point of time depends on the product of outstanding 
messages in the communication channel and the quantum of power migration, $\delta$.
Stability of network depends on the number of outstanding messages $K$, where $K$ is
also a function of the rate(s) of power migration of source node(s) and transfer times for
messages over the communication network. To ensure safe and stable operation, an upper 
bound for maximum outstanding messages $Kmax_{global}$ is established prior to power
transfer phase based on physical and network restrictions. $Kmax_{global}$ is distributed
among the communicating nodes as in Figure\ref{fig:Kmax_distribution} so that each node 
$i$ is given a limit, $Kmax_i$, on the number of outstanding messages it can have in the
system. For example, $Kmax_{global}$ can be distributed among the $n$ nodes in proportion to the excess
power that nodes have at the end of the state collection phase, as shown in equation below,
where $P_s$ is the excess power of node $s$. 

\begin{equation}
Kmax_s = \lfloor(\frac{P_s}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i}) * Kmax_{global}\rfloor
\label{eq:kmax_distrib}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \caption{$Kmax_{global}$ Distribution Among Sender Nodes}
  \label{fig:Kmax_distribution}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The message scheduling algorithm running at node $s$, adapts the power 
message migration rate $r_s$ or, inversely, the period $p_s$ such that the number of outstanding messages
of node $s$ at any given time, namely $K_s$ ($\sum_{i=1}^n K_i = K$), never exceeds its maximum allowed 
outstanding messages $Kmax_s$.


{\bf Message Scheduling Invariant ($I_S$).}

For a given power transfer phase and based on above $Kmax_s$, $p_s$ constraints, following scheduling invariant
$I_s$ can be formed, shown in
Equations \ref{eq:sched_invariant_1} - \ref{eq:sched_invariant_4}.
\begin{equation}
\{I_S = I_k \wedge I_c \wedge I_p\}
\label{eq:sched_invariant_1} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_k: K_s < Kmax_s 
\label{eq:sched_invariant_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_c: RT_s^{ex} \leq PT - t 
\label{eq:sched_invariant_3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_p: t - LT(s) \geq p_s
\label{eq:sched_invariant_4}
\end{equation}

Here, $PT$ is the end time of the power transfer phase, $t$ is the time at which
the invariant is evaluated and $LT(s)$ is the time at which the last power
migration message was initiated by node $s$. Work done in~\cite{acsmartgrid} shows the importance of
composing system correctness through conjunction of physical $I_p$ and scheduling $I_s$ invariants in order
to maintain system stability.
