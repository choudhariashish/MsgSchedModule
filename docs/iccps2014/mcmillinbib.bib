Information flow is an inherent property of CPSs and is of particular interest at their cyber-physical boundaries. This thesis focuses on discovering information flow properties and proposes a process to model the information flow in CPSs. A Cooperating FACTS Power System serves as a tangible example to illustrate modeling information flow using the proposed process. The proposed process can be used to model the information flow security, help analyze current information flow security requirements, and aid in the design of further security policies in a CPS.},

These multiple equilibria can arise from a common power injection model for the same terminal conditions of shunt bus voltage and series active and reactive power injections.   The multiple equilibria result in two or more sets of eigenvalues, some of which may indicate an unstable operating condition.  Therefore, the use of the UPFC power injection model must be used with caution to ensure stable operation of the UPFC.}

Information flow is an inherent property of CPSs and is of particular interest at their cyber-physical boundaries. This thesis focuses on discovering information flow properties and proposes a process to model the information flow in CPSs. A Cooperating FACTS Power System serves as a tangible example to illustrate modeling information flow using the proposed process. The proposed process can be used to model the information flow security, help analyze current information flow security requirements, and aid in the design of further security policies in a CPS.},

These multiple equilibria can arise from a common power injection model for the same terminal conditions of shunt bus voltage and series active and reactive power injections.   The multiple equilibria result in two or more sets of eigenvalues, some of which may indicate an unstable operating condition.  Therefore, the use of the UPFC power injection model must be used with caution to ensure stable operation of the UPFC.}
