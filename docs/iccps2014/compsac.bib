              cyber-physical systems that arise from the
              intrinsic heterogeneity, concurrency, and
              sensitivity to timing of such systems. It uses a
              portion of an aircraft vehicle management systems
              (VMS), specifically the fuel management subsystem,
              to illustrate the challenges, and then discusses
              technologies that at least partially address the
              challenges. Specific technologies described
              include hybrid system modeling and simulation,
              concurrent and heterogeneous models of
              computation, the use of domain-specific ontologies
              to enhance modularity, and the joint modeling of
              functionality and implementation architectures.},

ABSTRACT = {Designing cyber-physical systems(CPSs)increasingly requires the use of multi-domain models throughout the development process. Ensuring consistent relationships between various system models is an important part of an integrated design methodology. This paper describes an architectural approach to reasoning about relations between heterogeneous system models. The runtime base architecture of the system is used as a unifying representation to compare the structure and semantics of the associated models. Each model is related to the base architecture through the abstraction of an architectural view, which captures structural and semantic correspondences between model elements and system entities. The use of the architectural view framework to relate system models from different domains is illustrated in the context of a quadrotor air vehicle.},
